# Handwritten Digit Recognizer
Detection of handwritten digits using deep learning, it uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

## MNIST dataset
The MNIST database of handwritten digits,has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

## Convolutional Neural Networks
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks, based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.

## Tkinter (Python based GUI tool)
Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface.

**Note:** If you are using [repl.it](https://repl.it/~) then Tkinter won't work. It is recommended to use [REMI GUI](https://remi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [Python Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
